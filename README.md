Yet another pair of roman number encoder/decoder functions.

I finished the well known roman numbers kata with python3.

I did implement both, part I and II.

There is a nice, concise solution for part I available from the
Coding Dojo (please read
http://codingdojo.org/solution/KataRomanNumeralsAsReadableAsWeCouldMakeIt/
for reference). But I liked my own code more, mostly, because 
it does use the
same rule set for both directions, back and forth.
